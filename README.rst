A low-level interface to a growing number of Amazon Web Services. The
botocore package is the foundation for
`AWS-CLI <https://github.com/aws/aws-cli>`__.

`Documentation <https://botocore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__

**WARNING**

Botocore is currently under a developer preview, and its API is subject
to change prior to a GA (1.0) release.  Until botocore reaches a 1.0 release,
backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.

If you need a stable interface, please consider using
`boto <https://github.com/boto/boto>`__.
