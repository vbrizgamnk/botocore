Building the JSON Models
========================

Everything in ``./botocore/data/aws`` is autogenerated, there is no need to
manually edit these files.  These files in this directory are a combination of
the original ``.json`` file as well as custom annotations specified in other
files.


All of the original data lives in ``./services``.  This directory has these
files:

* ``_regions.json``
* ``_services.json``.  A list of services and supported regions and protocols.
* ``<servicename>.json``.  This is the original service model.
* ``<servicename>.extra.json``.  Additional data that is merged with
  ``<servicename>.json``.

To build a single model, use the ``scripts/modelbuild`` command::

  $ scripts/modelbuild services/sqs.json

This will print the final model to stdout, so to update the models in
``./botocore/data/aws`` you can run::

  $ scripts/modelbuild services/sqs.json > botocore/data/aws/sqs.json

Alternatively, there is a ``script/buildall`` that you can run with no
arguments.  It will automatically build all of the services in the
``./services`` directory and place them in the appropriate location in
``botocore/data/aws``.  It will also copy the ``_regions.json`` and
``_services.json`` file into ``botocore/data/aws``.
